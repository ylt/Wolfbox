Wolfbox
=======
this is v1 of Wolfbox - a C# image board viewer, development of this version has stopped in order
to make an even more open version where all the access data is defined in XML.

v1 has flaws in its download mechanism and viewing, and only supports a single API interface/site, v2 will implement
many interfaces per site, in order to allow maximum compatiblility. For non-supported sites, a GUI interface will
be offered, in order to make adding new sites as simple as drag and drop.

From my own research, no other decent clients exist - they each use bad access methods, likely to topple over, etc...

An old attempt at v2 is available in the v2 branch, but it's been put back to the planning stage to get a better
idea of how it should all fit together (and to jog my memory).

This will be licensed under GPL 2 or 3 once in a decent state, but for now it's (c) Joe Carter + Francisco Arias. You
may do what the Github terms permit you to do (notably make a fork, make changes, etc), but anything further than that
please ask permission.
